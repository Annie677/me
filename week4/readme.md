dictionary: 
my_dictionary = {"key": "vaule"}
my_dictionary = ["key"]
So it will return the values. Two dictionaries are able to be merged together which is more complex. 
Eg.
dict_0 = {"key: "value"}
 
my_dict["degrees"] = {"another_thing": "A", "B", "Apple": 0}
my_dict["degrees"]["everything"] = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

for the item "4", 
my_dict["degrees"]["everything"][3]

There are some layers between the dictionaries. In the example, the first layer is the "degrees".Then, the "everything" layer which is inside of the first layer.
