TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear
'While' loop is able to run a command as a prerequisite. 
I think that the "range" is much more easier to return the expected results than the "while loop" in the exerise1. 
range (start, stop, step) is able to provide the needed items from the "beginning" to the "ending" with the expected steps. 
HOWEVER, the loops are more complicated to return the same list that I have to write " my_number += step" and define the "my_number" in the loop.
